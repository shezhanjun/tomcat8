<h1>Servlet
Examples with Code</h1>
<p>This is a collection of examples which demonstrate some of the more
frequently used parts of the Servlet API. Familiarity with the Java(tm)
Programming Language is assumed.
<p>These examples will only work when viewed via an http URL. They will
not work if you are viewing these pages via a "file://..." URL. Please
refer to the <i>README</i> file provide with this Tomcat release regarding
how to configure and start the provided web server.
<p>Wherever you see a form, enter some data and see how the servlet reacts.
When playing with the Cookie and Session Examples, jump back to the Headers
Example to see exactly what your browser is sending the server.
<p>To navigate your way through the examples, the following icons will
help:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: none; padding-left: 0;">
<li><img src="images/execute.gif" alt=""> Execute the example</li>
<li><img src="images/code.gif" alt=""> Look at the source code for the example</li>
<!-- <li><img src="images/read.gif" alt=""> Read more about this feature</li> -->
<li><img src="images/return.gif" alt=""> Return to this screen</li>
</ul>

<p>Tip: To see the cookie interactions with your browser, try turning on
the "notify when setting a cookie" option in your browser preferences.
This will let you see when a session is created and give some feedback
when looking at the cookie demo.</p>
